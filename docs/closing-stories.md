# Closing Stories Guide

Each chapter concludes with a short story drawn from Kabbalistic myth, mytho-history, or real events. The tales are retold in Scott Alexander's wry voice while remaining faithful to reputable sources. They should illuminate the chapter's main idea and spark further reflection rather than tie everything up neatly.

`config/outline.yaml` lists a one-line description of the story for each chapter so agents can weave it naturally into the draft. The full sources are indexed in the back matter.
