# Prompt Checklist

Every drafting prompt must include the following elements:

- Reference the style rules in `config/style.md`.
- Incorporate key research notes for the section.
- Include the closing story only when `final_part` is `true`.
- Keep the entire prompt under **400 tokens**.
- Express commands so `DraftWriter` can take direct action.
