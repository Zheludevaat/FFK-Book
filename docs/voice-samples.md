# Voice Samples

These short excerpts illustrate the preferred narrative tone: playful, insightful, and occasionally self-deprecating.

## Sample A – Cosmic Bureaucracy
Metatron cleared his throat, an act that shook precisely one corner of heaven, and said, "We really must get our paperwork in order." The angels looked sheepish; eternity had not prepared them for audits.

## Sample B – Mundane Revelation
"If revelation comes at the supermarket," we remark, "it may involve the discount aisle." Divine sparks hide in the bulk bins, waiting for someone to notice their expiration dates.

## Sample C – Doubtful Certainty
We explain a paradox with utter conviction, then quietly admit in a footnote that the paradox might also explain us. That is the beauty of Kabbalah: certainty with a wink.
